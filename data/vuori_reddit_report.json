Almost like the top width belongs on a size down. It still works well enough to wear but I went with a Vuori Tuvalu to see if I could find my go-to shirt. I really like the Tuvalu (not perfect but no obvious weakness for me) but the material looks cheaper. \n\nNot cheap per se but Asket has a super subtle sheen to it I really like and Vuori doesn't really have that from what I can see except for their tech shirt that's not so much for casual wear.\n\nHoping someone who has experiemented with one or both of these brands might have an alternative or ideas? I've gone through so many brands now and still haven't found an all arounder.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m curious about what you all think: what\u2019s the best athletic brand out there right now?\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of competition:\n\n\t\u2022\tNike\n\t\u2022\tUnder Armour (my personal favorite)\n\t\u2022\tAdidas\n\t\u2022\tReebok\n\t\u2022\tFila\n\t\u2022\tGymshark\n\t\u2022\tPuma\n\t\u2022\tRussell Athletic\n\t\u2022\tChampion\n\t\u2022\tNew Balance\n\nFor me, Under Armour is my favorite and my go to. It has the perfect balance between comfort, style, and performance, especially their t shirts, shoes, and even other forms of clothing (sweatpants, jackets, polos, quarter zips, etc). But I know a lot of people swear by Nike for style or New Balance for comfort.\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering, what brand do you think makes the best athletic gear overall, and why? Are you judging by performance, comfort, or just how good it looks?\n",

I\u2019m looking for brands with subtly interesting details.\n\nIf I had to characterize my style it's somewhere between Aether at the high end for outerwear, James Perse in the high-mid, and the brands below for more \"affordable\" stuff.\n\nBoxer Briefs: Mack Weldon \n\nSolidly made Casual Button Down Shirts: Taylor Stitch, Faherty, Relwen \n\nLightweight Casual Button Downs: Jcrew Secret Wash, James Perse, Todd Snyder, Billy Reid \n\nDress shirts: Paul Smith, Theory, Hugo Boss \n\nSuits: Theory, Paul Smith, Varvatos, Jcrew (don't wear a lot of suits) \n\nSunspel-style polo shirts: Mack Weldon \n\nJeans: I used to swear by Banana Republic Grey Japanese Traveler Jeans, but they stopped making them. Now I haven't found a great jean company. Tried many. Thoughts?\n\nChinos: Jcrew 484s, Perk (have one pair, seems good) \n\nTshirts: Buck Mason, Vuori Rise Cotton (no longer made but they were great), Outerknown \n\nSweatshirts: Outerknown, Buck Mason \n\nOuterwear: Relwen, Aether, Fjallraven. Also have several jackets from Nau that I love, but they went out of business. \n\nShoes: Many pairs of Campers, Nikes, Blundstones, Karhus, Onitsuka Tiger.\n\nInterested in your brands.\n\nEDIT: went through a period where I bought a lot of tech-fabric workwear like Western Rise and Ministry of Supply. Their stuff is cool and subtly interesting in details. Then I realized I prefer natural fabrics.\n\nEDIT2: Lots of people recommend J.Crew for the sizing, and for me too, the sizing is generally spot on. Their poplin secret wash shirts and 484 chinos are dialed.\n\nWhich leads me to the question: why are so many other brands so BAD at sizing? I have a graveyard of shirts and pants from Notjcrew that I wear a few times and then decide they suck\u2014almost entirely because of sizing.\n\nI think there's a lane for a company that just rips off JCrew sizing, but uses more interesting fabrics and patterns, with better details. I gues that's kind of Todd Snyder but I find their stuff hit or miss.",

It\u2019s not a tightness issue either as the thigh part is relatively loose. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a durability issue, as I do lots of deadlifts and where the bar scrapes my shins I haven\u2019t had any issues.",

Their middle market stuff is solid. Their high end stuff still remains next level. Let\u2019s just take sweatpants as an example, their stuff in the ~$50 range is whatever, easy skip, go somewhere else. The stuff in the ~$75 range is solid enough, not amazing but you won\u2019t complain. Then you get ~$100+ and they are just so much better than vuori, lululemon, whatever other premium brand. If I need something cheap, Nike isn\u2019t the place to go, but if you need something nice, it still remains one of the best options. \n\nI usually just wait for sales for the high-end items to drop to middle tier levels and scoop them up, rarely disappointed.",

Also depends what activity you\u2019re doing. \u201cActive\u201d can mean lots of things. I wear different things hiking vs lifting vs running etc.\n\nI\u2019m 45 so not quite 50 but I wear Vuori and Oliver\u2019s/Myles Apparel. I like Rabbit and Path Projects for running clothing too. I agree that the pricier stuff tends to perform better and last longer. Feels better too which is the most important factor imo.",
