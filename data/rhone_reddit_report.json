It has the perfect balance between comfort, style, and performance, especially their t shirts, shoes, and even other forms of clothing (sweatpants, jackets, polos, quarter zips, etc). But I know a lot of people swear by Nike for style or New Balance for comfort.\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering, what brand do you think makes the best athletic gear overall, and why? Are you judging by performance, comfort, or just how good it looks?\n",

      "title": "Review of five cotton-based 5-pocket pants",
      "text": "## Criteria\n\nI recently decided to branch out from my usual Levi's and look for a new 'everyday' pant. Specifically I'm looking for:\n\n - Easy to dress up or down\n\n - Easy to care for (wash cold, hang dry)\n\n - Decent quality, nice details\n\n - Won't fall apart or bag out in six months\n\n - $75-$150 per pair\n\nFinally, early on I found recommendations for 100% polyester pants from Lululemon, Vuori, Rhone, etc. but I decided they're just not for me. They all seem to have a texture that reminds me of the polyester pants I picked up from REI for camping, which isn't bad but not the look and feel I want for everyday wear. I know others swear by these pants, so of course wear what makes you happy, but for me that's a mostly cotton blend, which is why you won't see those products in this review.\n\n\n## About Me\n\nI'm approaching 40 and WFH in IT. I'm going out less and less these days, but I like to look nice even if it's just for myself and my wife. I'm fairly average in build, weight and height; I hit the gym but mostly for keeping my shape vs. getting in one. I generally prefer muted colors and lean into interesting textures when choosing what to wear, but I'm not particularly fashion-forward. I'm also not brand focused, but looking in my closet I see pieces from Taylor Stitch, Spier &amp; MacKay, Eddie Bauer, Levi's, and Banana Republic.\n\n\n## The Reviews\n\n**Todd Snyder 5-Pocket Chino (Slim) - $148**\n\n*--90% Cotton, 8% Polyester, 2% Lycra--*\n\nI purchased three pairs of these pants so I could use a code for 25% off a $400 purchase. I had also read about sizing inconsistencies, so I figured picking up multiple pairs would help me spot anything that was off.\n\nAnd I'm happy to report the sizing was consistent for all pairs. These felt soft, substantial, and the most denim-like of what I reviewed, with the most pleasant and comfortable stretch of all the pairs I've tested. There was an interesting [weave-like texture](https://i.imgur.com/6bxFw1O.jpeg) on the pants, which I liked, but ultimately wasn't my favorite. I also noticed the back belt loop was intentionally offset, which some prefer, and the usual leather patch at the belt loop is an attractive leather suede with colors intended to pair with the color of the pants -- a nice touch. For fit, these felt good but just a little tighter than expected, which made me a little worried about eventual shrinkage. My wife noticed these pants seemed to emphasize [my crotch](https://i.imgur.com/PQwrSxT.jpeg) somehow(?), and after a few laughs we took some photos and compared them to the other pants in this review and yeah, she was right.\n\nA couple other notes, the fabric flap covering the fly didn't want to stay flat on all three pairs. Finally, the zipper was the least smooth of all the pants I tried.\n\n\n**Banana Republic Slim Brushed Traveler Pant - $110**\n\n*--99% Cotton, 1% Elastane--*\n\nEDIT: For clarity, this is *not* the more popular Slim Traveler Pant 2.0. That pant is 58% cotton, 32% modal, 7% polyester, and 3% elastane. This \"brushed\" pant is entirely different except for the word \"Traveler\". IMO BR marketing botched this. 'Traveler' pants are pants designed for low maintenance and comfort over a long day of business travel (e.g. Rhone's Commuter Pant). BR has decided to co-opt the word 'traveler' as a brand name, which just muddies everything.\n\nI purchased six(!) pairs of these pants because I thought these would be my favorite, and there was a pretty good holiday sale (40% off) with additional savings on one or two colors. I also read about how the colors didn't match the pictures on their site, and these looked like they weren't going to be offered all year.. so I figured what the heck, buy 'em out.\n\nThese weren't what I expected, almost a corduroy and pajama mashup with a light 'nap' on the [twill-patterned fabric](https://i.imgur.com/lnbv4VY.jpeg). They do advertise as 'moleskin' and 'flannel-like', which I'd say is accurate but seemed like typical puffery when I placed the order -- oh well. Very soft and very warm, but a bit thinner than expected. These are very much a cold-weather pant and they would dress up well as a corduroy alternative. The stretch was good, not as smooth as Todd's but still quite good, just a bit more bungie-like and 'linear', if that makes sense. No offset back belt loop. For the darker colors, I wish BR varied the hardware a bit (maybe copper?). For fit, there was no issue with the 'fly flap' like with the TS pants, and they felt slightly more relaxed, certainly longer too (in a good way). These felt like a true, comfortable slim. I don't worry about shrinkage, but maybe pilling? Generally I'm happy with this purchase, but this wasn't really the everyday pant I set out for.\n\n**Flint &amp; Tinder 365 Pant (Slim) - $98**\n\n*--98% Cotton, 2% Spandex--*\n\nI purchased only one pair here, and I'm glad I did. These were by far my least favorite of the pants I tried, with few redeeming qualities. The fit was technically correct, but the stretch was abysmal; bending a knee pulled fabric from the seat, which was strange and uncomfortable. Again, the flap covering the fly didn't lie flat, and the button [attempting to imitate a bullet](https://i.imgur.com/GjDLtk2.jpeg) is juvenile and frankly stupid. I wanted more hardware. The [fabric](https://i.imgur.com/j3gS7xT.jpeg) was thin and boring, but also 'splotchy', like it showed where it was last touched (similar to how velvet changes sheen when tampered with). Even the back pockets are too small. I read a million great reviews on this pant and had high hopes, but these were unquestionably my least favorite.\n\n\n**Proof Rover Pant (Slim) - $98**\n\n*--73% Cotton, 25% Recycled Polyester, 2% Lycra--*\n\nThese were great pants! Very substantial, with a heavier weight and [interesting canvas texture](https://i.imgur.com/C7L6G5T.jpeg) that I really liked. The extra gusseting ensured my crotch was *not* a prominent feature like with the TS pants, so they looked flatter in the front in an appealing way. I also really liked the simple black hardware, which they didn't skimp on! The fit was great, maybe a little tight around the calves on first wear but quickly forgotten. An extra half inch in length would have been appreciated, IMO.. maybe just me. My wife and I agreed these would be simple to dress up with a solid or patterned button down, or keep casual with other offerings on the Huckberry site... so that checks about all the boxes I can check before real-world wear and washing.\n\n**Proof Rover Pant (Straight) - $98**\n\n*--73% Cotton, 25% Recycled Polyester, 2% Lycra--*\n\nI couldn't resist and ordered another pair, same fabric but this time in a straight fit as a comparison to slim. Again, the fit was spot on, only this time with a bit more fabric around the calves and the seat of the pants. Looking at pictures, the slim definitely fit me best. The hundreds of reviews of these pants do not mention shrinkage (probably due to the 25% polyester), so assuming that's true, I think I've found my pant.\n\n\n## Final Rankings and Thoughts\n\n1st: *Proof Rover Slim or Straight ($98).* Super excited to try these as an alternative to my usual denim. It feels like I unlocked a new style choice without making sacrifices to comfort and ease of wear, and the style itself is surprisingly versatile. I'll be picking up more of the slims once all my other returns go through (lol).\n\n2nd: *Banana Republic Slim Brushed Traveler Pant ($110).* This feels a little like dabbling into corduroy, with mixed results. Since I don't currently own any corduroy I'll probably keep one or two of these pairs and return the rest. Fine pants, but again not really what I set out for, but again fine pants.\n\n3rd: *Todd Snyder 5-Pocket Chinos ($148).* These are good, they just missed a few key details that matter to me, namely the fit issue but a few other things too. But the fabric is comfortable and the stretch especially is very good. If these fit you better and you don't mind the extra $50 cost, maybe worth a pick up? \n\n4th: *Flint and Tinder 365 Pant ($98).* I don't know who these pants are for. All cotton except for 2% elastane is a pretty common blend, so what do you get with this $100 version? Poor stretch, missing details, thinner fabric? Throw a rock and you'll hit a better pant with a bit of stretch for under 100 bucks. Skip.\n\n## Other Contenders\n\n - *Duer.* I first thought these were 100% polyester, but they're indeed mostly cotton. If I were willing to try another pant, it'd probably be these, but something about the texture looks a little off to me, and I didn't want to try anything with more than 2% stretch.\n\n - *Taylor Stitch.* As far as I know all their pants are high quality, but 100% cotton, which can make them more prone to wrinkles and shrinking. If you were thinking of leaning fully into 100% cotton, these have great reviews.",

      "text": "I recently accepted a job that requires me to return to the office after years of working from home. The dress code is business casual, so I don\u2019t need anything overly formal. I\u2019ve discovered the Lululemon ABC 5-Pocket Warpstreme pants and the Vuori Meta pants\u2014and I\u2019m absolutely hooked! They\u2019re extremely comfortable and still work perfectly for office attire. While they\u2019re a bit pricey, I think they\u2019re worth every penny.\n\nNow I\u2019m looking for similar high-quality shirt options, specifically button-downs and polos. Since summers are quite warm, I\u2019d prefer lightweight, moisture-wicking fabrics. I\u2019d also like shirts without noticeable logos, but with modern, tasteful designs and colors. For reference, I\u2019m 6'2\", 220 lbs, with an athletic build, so that is important.\n\n  \nEDIT: Many suggestions emphasize sticking with LLL and Vuori shirts to match the pants, but I should have clarified\u2014I find those a bit too casual for what I\u2019m aiming for. I think I can pull off the more casual pants if the shirt is a bit dressier. I\u2019m also particular about having a crisp, non-wrinkled collar; a rumpled one just looks sloppy to me. I feel like there are traditionally styled polos and button-downs made with high-quality performance fabrics that would work well. Additionally, I\u2019m not a fan of the shorter sleeve trend. I don\u2019t need them to reach my elbow, but as someone taller, most end up riding too high\u2014often more than halfway up my bicep.",

      "text": "It really depends on the specifics of the style you want. Want a pique polo (a \"traditional\" style)? Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers are good choices though I'd watch for a sale. Todd Snyder just launched one if you want something a bit plainer (they don't put a chest logo). Most higher end designers have options here and if you can catch a sale on Saks or Mr. Porter or something you can find some good options for really high end stuff. Sunspel's polo is also a go-to here.\n\nIf you want something a bit different, I'd suggest a knit polo (sometimes called a sweater polo). I think they tend to look better because they use sweater-style ribbing at the waist so even if they're long on you (as many polos are), they'll look good untucked. SuitSupply has a lot of great options there, as does Todd Snyder. Same answer about the higher end as for pique polos as well.\n\nIf you want an athelisure polo (sweat-wicking, stretchy fabric), which I'd really only recommend if the aim is to have a polo that you can golf in, I'd look at Lululemon or Sun Day Red, or any other major athelisure brand like Vuori or Rhone etc.",

      "text": "My current favorite blazer that I wear year round is the discontinued NAU Vice Blazer that I learned about from a Tim Ferris podcast over a decade ago. It's 60% recycled polyester, 40% organic cotton with a DWR finish. I can't stress enough how amazing this simple piece of clothing has been and the amount of compliments I've received on it over the years. It's nearly impossible to wrinkle even when crumpled up for days. It repels water and breathes well, yet breaks the wind and is just warm enough for many spring and fall days, and it's machine washable. The problem is it was only available in grey.\n\nI'm looking for something similar, casual yet slightly dressy, ideally available in navy and maybe a lighter tan or off white for summer. The more breathable the better as I typically wear this more to dress up an outfit than to actually keep warm.

I got a few alo items (second hand, the price seemed a lot for me) including a couple leggings and a bra. I actually decently like the bra, but none of the leggings I have enjoyed. The material is not comfy and I cannot imagine working out in them. I tried 3 of them second hand but they were all barely worn. I didn't even get around to washing them often enough to tell if there was a quality decline. I got the small and it was too loose; the XS was too tight. There's one pair of shorts I got second hand that I am obsessed with (the material of this one really reminds me of the Lululemon I enjoyed) but I think it sells for like 80 bucks (and I got it second hand for 10 so I found it hard to justify). I'm at the stage where I get Lulu from the outlets so I pay 30 for shorts, 45 for leggings and 29 for bras and I am okay with that. Am I trying the wrong things from Alo? I guess I have no idea when the items I got are from so I can't judge the Alo brand fully, but is there anything they sell that anyone really recommends or are they just trendy? Is there any brands similar to Lululemon that people would recommend? I'll pay more if the quality is better and they last longer!",

I want to keep that quality, that I love especially since everyone is saying it\u2019s starting to go downhill.
