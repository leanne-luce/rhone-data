I told them I was uncomfortable that someone had my shipping info and also wanted access to my order history, including recent orders. Only upon insisting were they able to send me email address to contact. I sent the same info, waited 3 days just for instructions to reset my email. I explained why that was impossible, sent them a recent order number to help triangulate, and waited 3 days just to receive a \"Hello,\u00a0We are not able to triangulate orders to a new account.\u00a0Since the account was hacked, we recommend signing up with a new email and use a more secure password.\"\n\nI understand lululemon is not a technology company, but this cybersecurity handling is *crazy*. I can't imagine Lulu is that far away from a massive data breach.\n\nFor the record, my password is a randomly generated string through Bitwarden (it's not \\`password1\\` or something dumb, I literally do not know what my password is and log in using password manager). I don't know how someone would gain access to my account, but I reset my email password (which has 2fa enabled) just to be safe.\n\nThis is part venting my frustration, part sharing a warning, part looking for suggestions on how to escalate. Anyways thanks for reading\n\nrecommend changing your lululemon password just in case- if there's a data breach, heard it here first.\n\nedit: formatting got weird",

While I agreed we could start a collection, he hasn't brought it up again since we've been focused on getting everything for our baby on the way. I want to put together a little self care kit to add to his Christmas present, but there is SO much information on what defines \"nice\" underwear for men, and I really wish I had pressed a little more for what he had in mind at the time.\n\nHe likes cotton and wears boxer briefs and trunks. Are there specific go-to brands anyone would recommend specifically, especially for comfort and/or moisture wicking materials? Tom Ford, Lululemon, Calvin Klein, etc?",

My friends call bullshit saying it\u2019s all the same material with a different label printed on it and you\u2019re paying for the brand instead of comfort calling it status symbol. I\u2019ve had a couple of jackets which are cheaper that honestly still look and feels amazing today. But I bought a more premium called moncler which I got from some cash I won at rolling riches and it started fraying or fading after just a few months which made me wonder if I got fucked over by the branding. I also think it has to do with luck and what kind of items you buy for example shoes and outerwear seem to hold up better if you spend more but stuff like shirts and hoodies don't make much difference. What do you guys think? Is it brand or comfort you're looking for when shopping for a new item?",

The lawsuit isn't just that Costco ripped off the design. It's that it copied the trademarked non-functional stitching patterns and shapes on the jackets, and some non-functional seams on the pants.\n\nIn my opinion (I'm a lawyer but not an intellectual property lawyer), the lawsuit has a stronger basis on the Define jackets than the Scuba hoodies, which in turn have a much stronger claim than the ABC Pant. The stitching in the Define jackets at issue seems like a much more prominent, and less functional, pattern than the ABC pant allegations. And lululemon actually registered trademarks in the Define jacket stitching patterns and the Scuba pocket shapes, without going through the same process in the ABC pants.\n\nBut also, the lawsuit also alleges that after Costco contracted with someone to manufacture the \"dupes,\" they *then benefited from a whisper campaign that it's actually manufactured by lululemon's own factories*. So it seems like a secondary purpose of the lawsuit is to quash the rumors and inform the public that lululemon has nothing to do with the manufacture of the Costco/Kirkland knockoffs.",

Not sure why Lululemon thinks that they're going to succeed where Louis Vuitton has failed time and time again.\n\nAt best, they'll be able to get the ITC to stop Costco's imports while the case proceeds in an attempt to force Costco to settle, much like what has happened to Apple multiple times with both their watch and iPhone, thanks to patent trolls.\n\nIf you happen to be invested in Lululemon, I'd recommend getting out now. Becoming a copyright, patent, or trademark troll, is often a sign of a company that's having difficulty with solvency.",

Chinos are really heavy to be wearing in summer, so if I run into the office when it\u2019s hot out, I\u2019d wear ABCs or something like them, and in winter it\u2019s chinos. I think two pairs of pants each for two different weights wouldn\u2019t be a big violation of minimalism. Also, you left out wool dress pants, which are a dressier option, if you wanted a non-synthetic option.",
